### notes-node - Learning Nodejs, javascript, mongodb, ejs(templating language)
Welcome to my repos about learning nodejs and javascript. In this repository I will try to make notes about nodejs learnings and also share my knowledge about what i have learnt during my learning period.

`javascript
var learning = require('all-learning');

learnig.spread({
  user: "all",
  age: "all",
});
learning.motivation({
  isPainful: true,
  isEasy: true,
});
learning.curve({
  first: "Eat",
  second: "Code",
  third: "Sleep",
  fourth: "Recursive",
});
